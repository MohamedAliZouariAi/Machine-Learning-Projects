In this project i used the following libraries:    
--> pandas  
--> numpy  
--> matplotlib  
--> seaborn  
--> sklearn  
  
This project has 5 steps :   
1) Load the data
2) Analyze and process the data using different graphs and descriptions  
3) Train the data with different algorithms to determine the best one
4) Evaluate the model
5) Test the model  
The final results of this project are :  
*) Accuracy score = 0.96  
*) Precision  =  0.95  
*) Recall = 0.97  
*) F1 score = 0.96
